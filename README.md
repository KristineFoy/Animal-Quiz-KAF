Animal Quiz KAF

## Developer

Kristine Foy
This is was a test of CSS,HTML and JavaScript skills learned to date.
This added in timers, countdowns and Javascript to my developer skills. Also helped further CSS skills and HTML functions.
I switched Var to Const in my code for personal preference.
Local storage and second HTML page where to be applied as well.
